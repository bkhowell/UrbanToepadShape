# Urban Toepad Shape: Puerto Rican Anoles

## Purpose

This repository houses scripts used to compare toepad shape between urban and forest populations of *Anolis cristatellus*. The scripts use 2D geometric morphometrics techniques and different statistical analyses.

## Organization 

This repository contains all data used in the final version of these analyses in the Data folder. Scripts are intended to be run in the following order (but are mostly interchangeable, with the exception of preliminary data setup which must be done first):
1. Howell PR Preliminary Data Setup.R
2. Howell PR Geometric Morphometrics Analyses.R
3. Howell PR Linear Analyses.R
4. Howell PR Methodological Analyses.R

All of these scripts should run on your local environment as is if you cloned the repository!
